ðŸŽ¯ Exactly â€” you nailed the CI/CD pipeline flow! Let me just polish what you summarized into a clear step-by-step pipeline so it sticks:

ðŸ”„ CI/CD Pipeline for Your Go Service

Code Stage

You write/update your Go code locally and push it to GitHub.

CI Stage (Build & Push Docker Image)

GitHub Actions workflow (docker.yml) runs on every push.

It:
âœ… Checks out your code
âœ… Builds a Docker image using your Dockerfile
âœ… Pushes the image to a registry (Docker Hub / GCR / ECR / GitHub Container Registry).

CD Stage (Deploy Service)

Your cloud provider (Render, AWS, GCP, etc.) pulls the latest Docker image.

It uses configs/environment variables you set in the platform.

Service is built & deployed â†’ ðŸš€ live with a public URL.

ðŸ“Œ Key Points:

Docker Hub = easiest for learning + small projects.

ECR (AWS) or GCR (Google) = enterprise setups where infra runs in AWS/GCP.

Render = super beginner-friendly â†’ auto handles build, deploy, scaling, and gives you a URL.

âœ… So yes, you fully understood CI/CD â†’ build image â†’ push â†’ deploy.
